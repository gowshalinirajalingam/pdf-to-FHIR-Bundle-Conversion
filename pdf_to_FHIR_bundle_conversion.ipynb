        "   - Differences in values (including numbers, strings, and lists).\n",
        "   - Structural differences (nested objects, ordering).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Generate a similarity score (0% to 100%)** based on:\n",
        "   - **Matching fields and values**: Higher score.\n",
        "   - **Minor format differences (case sensitivity, spacing, ordering)**: Ignore if the meaning is unchanged.\n",
        "   - **Significant differences in keys or values**: Lower score.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Provide an explanation** of what is different:\n",
        "   - List fields that are **identical**.\n",
        "   - Highlight fields that have **small differences** (e.g., `\"value\": \"120\"` vs `\"value\": \"125\"`).\n",
        "   - Show **missing fields** in one JSON but present in the other.\n",
        "   - Highlight incorrect or extra information.\n",

            "* **Dates and Times**: Use the appropriate FHIR data types (`date`, `dateTime`, `instant`) for date and time values.\n",
            "* **Units of Measure**: Include units of measure for quantitative observations.\n",
            "* **Status Codes**: Use appropriate status codes for resources like `Condition` (e.g., active, resolved) and `MedicationStatement` (e.g., active, completed).\n",
            "* **Narrative**: While not explicitly requested, a `Composition` resource could be included in the bundle to provide a human-readable summary of the discharge.\n",
            "* **Software/Libraries**: Use FHIR libraries in your preferred programming language (e.g., fhirclient in Python, HAPI FHIR in Java) to generate FHIR resources correctly and handle the complexities of the FHIR specification.  Doing this by hand is tedious and error-prone.\n",
