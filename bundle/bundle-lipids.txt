DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Patient Details:
Name: John Doe
Date of Birth: 15 March 1985
Gender: Male
Medical Record Number: 123456789
Admission Date: 01 February 2025
Discharge Date: 08 February 2025
Attending Physician: Dr. Emily Carter, MD
Consultant: Dr. Robert Sinclair, MD (Cardiology)
--------------------------------------------------
Primary Diagnosis:
- Acute Myocardial Infarction (ST-Elevation)

Secondary Diagnoses:
- Hypertension
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
- Hyperlipidemia
- Obesity (BMI: 32)

Procedures Performed:
- Coronary Angiography (02 February 2025)
- Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with Drug-Eluting Stent Placement (03 February 2025)
--------------------------------------------------
Clinical Course:

Mr. John Doe was admitted to the hospital on 01 February 2025 via the emergency department after experiencing severe chest pain radiating to his left arm. Initial ECG showed ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. Emergency coronary angiography was performed, revealing a 95% occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA). On 03 February 2025, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed successfully with the placement of a drug-eluting stent.

Post-procedure, the patient was monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) for 48 hours. He was initiated on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and ticagrelor, along with atorvastatin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. His post-procedural course was uneventful, with no further episodes of chest pain. Serial cardiac enzyme levels showed a downward trend, and follow-up ECGs demonstrated resolving ST elevations. His blood glucose levels were managed with insulin during hospitalization due to elevated fasting glucose. A dietitian was consulted for diabetes and weight management, and a structured cardiac rehabilitation plan was discussed.
